<h3> About the project  </h3>
<hr>

<ul>       

<li>  I developed a project that performs Create, Read, Update and Delete operations using Http methods with ASP.NET Core technology using C# Programming language.       </li>
<li>   I used the MVC design pattern in my project.      </li>
<li> I created the class equivalents of the tables corresponding to the database in my model folder.        </li>
<li>   I did not perform the View phase because my goal was to write the Backend side. In my Controller folder, I equipped it with a structure with http methods and saved the information about my database in my appsettings.json structure.      </li>
<li>   In my project, I adopted the "Code First" approach, an approach used by most software developers, and I used Migration technology to create the database.         </li>
